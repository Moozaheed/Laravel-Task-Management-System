# Laravel Task Management System

The Laravel Task Management System is a web application developed using the Laravel PHP framework. It provides a simple yet effective platform for managing tasks, allowing users to register, log in, and perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks.


## Features

- **User Authentication:** The system includes a secure user authentication system that allows users to register, log in, and log out.

- **Task Management:** Users can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on tasks. This includes creating new tasks, viewing existing tasks, updating task details, and deleting tasks.

- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive, providing a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes. This is achieved using Bootstrap.

- **Pagination:** Task listings are paginated, improving the user experience when navigating through a large number of tasks.

- **Middleware for Authorization:** Middleware is employed to restrict access to certain features, ensuring that only authenticated users can manage tasks.
